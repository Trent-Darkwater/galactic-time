# galactic-time
An open-source galactic time converter in both Python and JavaScript that receives an Earth date and time in UTC and outputs a Darkwater-universe date and time format for either one of Saturn's colonized moons. Accounts for leap years. Totally free to use â€” I'll be updating with more celestial bodies in the future.
